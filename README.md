# BossFightPlugin
A boss fight plugin for Minecraft 1.16.5, made for AmitTMB. (under development)

This is like not really like under development anymore, cause I've given up on it...
Here's footage of it completely breaking down, the targetting code broke I think? and it got stuck in a loop somehow...

In case I do something in the future with it, here are some problems that need solving:
1. Rework the targetting code so that it doesn't completely break. Also maybe put it in it's own separate class that everything can easily request.
2. Add the mcfunction files for the animations into the repo
3. Make the animation position refresher inside the actual mcfunction to reduce console spam
4. Rework particle system
5. Look over the main loops and things
6. Step 1: don't die (don't do it man, it gets better)
